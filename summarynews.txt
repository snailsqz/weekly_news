ðŸ“ŠWeekly Economy News (3 - 9 May 2025)

Hereâ€™s the lowdown on the latest economic news, served up in a casual, easy-to-digest wayâ€”plus a quick answer to how this might affect your US stock investments.  

First up, SMIC, Chinaâ€™s biggest chipmaker, saw its shares drop nearly 7% after missing earnings expectations. Even though revenue and profits grew year-over-year, they fell short of what analysts predicted. The company blamed "production fluctuations" for lower prices, and things might stay rocky into the next quarter. But thereâ€™s a silver lining: demand for their chips (mostly older-gen ones used in phones and gadgets) is strong, thanks to government subsidies and supply chain shifts in China. Their factory usage is up, tooâ€”almost 90% full! Still, US export controls limit their ability to make cutting-edge chips, so theyâ€™re stuck playing catch-up.  

For your US stocks? If youâ€™re invested in semiconductor companies, SMICâ€™s struggles could mean less competition for US chipmakers like Intel or AMDâ€”potentially good for them. But if you own tech stocks reliant on Chinese supply chains (like Apple), keep an eye on how these chip shortages or price swings might ripple out.  

Next, Celsius Networkâ€™s ex-CEO, Alex Mashinsky, got slapped with a 12-year prison sentence for fraud. His crypto "bank" collapsed in 2022, taking billions of customer dollars with it. Heâ€™s the latest in a line of fallen crypto kings, joining FTXâ€™s Sam Bankman-Fried (25 years), Binanceâ€™s CZ (4 months), and Terraâ€™s Do Kwon (still fighting charges). The takeaway? Cryptoâ€™s wild west days are over, and regulators are cracking down hard.  

For your US stocks? If youâ€™re into crypto-related stocks (like Coinbase or MicroStrategy), this cleanup might actually help long-term trust in the sector. But expect more volatility as regulators keep tightening the screws.  

Lastly, Lyftâ€™s stock popped 7% after boosting its share buyback plan to $750 million. Rides and revenue grew, and theyâ€™re expanding into Europe. Itâ€™s a rare win for a company whose stock is still down 80% since its 2019 IPO.  

For your US stocks? If you own Lyft or rival Uber, Lyftâ€™s rebound suggests ride-hailing demand is strongâ€”good for the industry. But Lyftâ€™s still tiny compared to Uber, so donâ€™t expect a major market shift.  

TL;DR: SMICâ€™s chip woes might help US semiconductor stocks, crypto crackdowns could stabilize crypto-related stocks long-term, and Lyftâ€™s buyback is a small bright spot in a tough market. Keep an eye on how global chip demand and crypto regulation play outâ€”theyâ€™ll ripple through your portfolio.
